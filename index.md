I am a lecturer in cybersecurity at the [University of Aberdeen](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/){:target="_blank"} in the group of [Prof. Dr. Cas Cremers](https://cispa.saarland/group/cremers/){:target="_blank"}. I received my DSc (Tech.) in Computer Science from [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en){:target="_blank"}, where I worked in the [Secure Systems Group](https://ssg.aalto.fi){:target="_blank"} under the supervision of [Prof. Tuomas Aura](https://www.aalto.fi/en/people/tuomas-aura){:target="_blank"}.

My research interests include <b>security protocols</b>, <b>formal verification</b>, and <b>standardization</b>. I use tools like the Tamarin prover, ProVerif, and DeepSec to analyze security protocols in the symbolic model of cryptography. I am also interested in the development and standardization of new protocols.

You can find a complete list of my publications, standards, and preprints under [Publications](/publications) and on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eL1vdicAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao){:target="_blank"}.
